In order to make this program work, you need to follow the following steps:
1. Download the zip file of the "final" branch of this project. This is the last completed version of the project.
2. You must then unzip this file and open the folder containing the solution (Group1_OOP.sln).
3. Double-click the .sln (Group1_OOP.sln) file to open the solution with Visual Studio.
4. In the folder containing the solution (the one you have unzipped), a folder named 'bin' should appear. It contains a folder named 'Debug'.
5. Select all .csv files and move them to this 'Debug' folder.
6. You can now go back to Visual Studio and launch the program.
